# Train-Scheduler

This train scheduler allows the user to input information about the name, destination, arrival time, etc. of each train. Connection to a firebase database then allows this inputted information to be stored, retrieved, and appended to the table on the page. 

The primary difficulty with this assignment was figuring out how to combine Moment.js with firebase and what not, given that I had just learned these. After review of the activities in class as well as some trial and error, I was able to work with these programs.
